# GG4257_IRP
This is my repository for the independent research project for the module GG4257: Urban Analytics as a Toolkit for Sustainable Development.

# Reproducing the Code
This repo has two files, GG4257_IRP_Report and GG4257_IRP_Code. The Report file contains the final report formatted in a way that is easy to read, with minimal code included. This is to replicate what a typical research paper would look like. The Code file contains all the code used throughout the Report. To clearly know which sections correlate, they use the sections throughout. That way, readers can have both files open, scrolling through them both simultaneously, recreating the Code as they go through the Report. 

Finally, I've published both the Report and Code on my GitHub and have linked all the necessary data in a Google Drive folder:
